Use template (GitHub Issue Summary to Email) to generate a GitHub issue summary report and email to a specified email address.

## Use case
Managers always like summaries. In this scenario, we generate a report out of the issues reported at a GitHub repository.
It contains information on how many issues are assigned to each contributor of the project, total issues opened and total
issues closed so far. You could configure this report to be generated daily and emailed out to the specified email address.
It will provide continuous feedback about the project issue status.

## Prerequisites
* Pull the template from central  
  `bal new -t choreo/github_issue_summary_to_email <newProjectName>`
* GitHub account
* Email account

## Configuration
Create a file called `Config.toml` at the root of the project.

### Config.toml
```
[<ORG_NAME>.github_issue_summary_to_email]
githubAccessToken = "<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>"  
repositoryName = "<REPO_NAME>"  
repositoryOwner = "<REPO_OWNER>"
recipientAddress = "<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>"
```
* GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN - obtain a [Personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) or [GitHub OAuth App token](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
* REPO_NAME - [create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)
* RECIPIENT_ADDRESS - an email address

## Testing
Run the Ballerina project created by the integration template by executing `bal run` from the root.

Once successfully executed, the GitHub issue summary report will be received to the email specified.
